Bolognese and Mozzarella Stuffed Spaghetti
Squash

It is impossible not to love this delicious recipe for bolognese and mozzarella stuffed spaghetti
squash. The bold meaty bolognese made with freshly roasted tomatoes and the melty
mozzarella cheese turns spaghetti squash into something plain into something exceptional.

Ingredients
. 1 Spaghetti Squash
. 1 tablespoon Olive Oil
. 2 cups Roasted Tomato Bolognese
. 4 slices of Fresh Mozzarella

Instructions

1. Heat your oven to 350 degrees. Use a sharp knife to slice the stem off the squash and
then slice the squash in half from top to bottom. Scoop out all of the seeds. Then brush
the inside of the squash with olive oil. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet with the
inside of the squash facing up. Roast for 20 minutes, then flip the squash over and roast
for another 20 minutes. Then test the squash with a fork to see if it is tender, if it isn't, let
it cook longer.

2. Once the squash is tender, use a fork to scoop all of the spaghetti-like strands out of the
squash skin and into a large bowl. Then add the bolognese and toss until the squash is
evenly coated. Return the squash to the hollowed out skins.

3. Top the squash with the slices of mozzarella and return to the oven to cook for another 30
minutes.

4. If you want to brown the mozzarella on top of the squash, finish the squash off under the
broiler for a minute.
