The Best Turkey Sandwich

Iam sharing my secrets to making the very best turkey sandwich. This is a lunch that I have
been eating for years, and I am sure you will love it too.

Servings 2 sandwiches

Ingredients
. 3 slices of Bacon

. 2 Everything Bagels

. 6 slices of Turkey

. Cheddar Cheese

. 4 slices of Heirloom Tomato
. 1/2 an Avocado

. 1 tablespoon Mayonnaise

. Stone Ground Mustard

Instructions
1. First, you need to heat your oven so that you can prepare the bacon. Heat your oven to
375 degrees, and place three slices of bacon on a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake
until crispy, this will take about 12 minutes. Then blot the extra grease with a paper towel
and cut each slice of bacon in half.

2. Slice your bagels if they aren't already. Start by layering 3 slices of turkey on each bagel.
Add the tomatoes on top. Then add the cheese - I used Cabot's presliced cheddar which is
smaller than the big slices from the deli and better suited for a bagelsandwich.1used 3
slices per sandwich.

3. Place the bagels on a parchment lined baking sheet. I bake them without putting the top
of the bagel on top of the sandwich, I leave it on the side to toast. This makes it easier to
add the avocado mayo and/or mustard before serving.

4. Bake the sandwiches for about 10 minutes, until the cheese has melted. While the
sandwiches bake, mash the avocado and mayonnaise together. Before serving the
sandwiches, add a thick layer of avocado mayonnaise. If you like you can also add some
stone ground mustard. Serve immediately.
