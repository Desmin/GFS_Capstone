Ingredients
. 21/2 pounds of Grape or Cherry Tomatoes

o about 2 tablespoons Olive Oil

. Sea Salt

. Freshly Ground Black Pepper

. 2-3 cups Chicken or Vegetable Broth

. 1-2 tablespoons Freshly Chopped Basil

. 1/4 cup grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano
. 10 ounces of Fresh Cheese Ravioli

. Optional garnish: Crumbled Bacon

Instructions

1. Heat your oven to 350 degrees.

2. Slice1 1/2 cups ofthe tomatoes into quarters. Place them on a parchment lined baking
sheet. Set aside. Slice all of the remaining tomatoes in half and place on a separate
parchment lined baking sheet. (The reasoning behind this is that the quartered tomatoes
will go into the soup, and the halved tomatoes will be purged). Drizzle olive oil over the
tomatoes and then generally top with salt and pepper. Roast for 35-45 minutes, until
most of the liquid has evaporated from the tomatoes.

3. Place the halved tomatoes in a blender, and pur√©e until smooth. Then pour into a pot and
heat over medium heat. Whisk in 2 cups of the broth. Once the soup base comes to a
simmer, add the cheese, basil, and roasted tomato. Let return to a simmer, and taste test
adding more salt and pepper if necessary.

4. Add the tortelinni and cook until they float, this will take about 3 minutes. If the soup
becomes too thick, stir in additional broth.

5. Serve topped with fresh basil, cheese, and maybe some crumbled bacon.
