Instructions

I. Start by peeling the tomatoes. To do this, cut small "x"s in the bottom ofthe tomatoes - you
just want the cut to be deep enough to break the skin of the tomato. Remove the stems. Bring
a pot of water to a boil, and prepare an ice bath. Place the tomatoes in the boiling water for
30-60 seconds, until the skin begins to peel. Then place the tomatoes in an ice bath for 5
minutes. Next, carefully peel the skin off the tomatoes.

2. To remove the seeds from the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes into quarters, hold the tomato
quarters over a strainer inserted into a bowl, and push the seeds out into the strainer. Place
the deseeded tomato in the bowl. Continue until all of the seeds have been removed from the
tomatoes. Use a rubber spatula to push the seeds against the strainer 50 all of thejuice goes
into the bowl.

3. Peel the cucumber, slice it in half. and then use a spoon to scoop out all of the seeds from the
center of the cucumber. Loosely chop the cucumberjust so it will ht in a blender.

4. Place the tomato, cucumber, salt, pepper, cumin, cayenne, lime juice, sugar, and garlic into a
blender. Mix until the gazpacho reaches an even consistency. Thin the gazpachowith 1-2 cups
to tomatojuice, until the gazpacho is as thick or thin as you desire.

5. Chill the gazpacho for 4 hours. Garnish with a swirl of olive oil, a sprinkle of ground black
pepper, and some croutons.
