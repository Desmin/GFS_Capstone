Avocado Cheddar Grilled Cheese Eg g in the Hole

A classic grilled cheese gets a major upgrade by adding mashed avocado and a runny egg in
the middle. It is a grown up version of egg in the hole - a breakfast that I fondly remember my
mother making for me when I was a kid. This version is even better, because I think we can
agree that cheese and avocado make most things better.

Servings 2

Ingredients
. 4 slices of Bread

q 1 tablespoon of Butter

. 1/2 an Avocado

q Salt and Pepper

. 4 slices of Cheddar Cheese
q 2 Eggs

Instructions
1. I like to start by buttering one side of each slice of bread. Putting the butter on the bread,
instead of the butter in the pan is definitely the best way to make grilled cheese.

2. Next you want to mash half of the avocado. I had a bigger avocado so half of it was just
enough, but you can use more or less avocado if you like. Add a touch of salt and pepper
to the mashed avocado.

3. Place two slices of bread on a cutting board with the buttered side facing down. Then
spread a layer of avocado on top of the bread, and arrange a layer of cheese on top of the
avocado. Top with the second slice of bread, buttered side facing up.

l Heat a skillet over medium heat and add the sandwiches. Toast the first side of the
sandwiches, this will take about 3-4 minutes. Then remove both sandwiches from the
skillet, and place them on a cutting board with the toasted side facing down. Use a cookie
cutter to cut a hole in the sandwiches.

5. Return the sandwiches, and the holes to the pan to toast the second sides. Turn the heat
down to low, and crack and egg into the hole of each sandwich. Cover the skillet, and turn
the heat up to high for 10 seconds. Then return the heat to low.

6. Let the sandwiches cook on low for about another 6-8 minutes, until the egg white has set
and the bread has toasted. Increase the heat ofthe burner to medium low it necessary.

7. Serve the sandwiches right away.
