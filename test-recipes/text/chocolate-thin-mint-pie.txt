Instructions

1. Heat your oven to 350 degrees.

2. Start by preparing the pie crust. Pour the cookies into a blender or food processor and
transform the cookies into small crumbs. Then pour into a bowl and stir in the melted
butter. Pour the mixture into an ungreased pie pan, and use a spoon or your fingers to
spread out the crumbs and press them into shape.

3. Next, prepare the pie filling. In a medium bowl, mix the eggs and sugar together. Then
add the butter, cocoa, flour, salt, and vanilla. Whisk together and then pour into the pie
crust. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the center of the pie sets.

4. While the pie is baking, prepare the whipped cream. Pour the cream, sugar, and vanilla
into the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat on a medium speed for 3-4 minutes, until the
cream forms peaks.

5. Once the pie has finished baking, let it cool before adding the whipped cream (otherwise
the cream will melt).
