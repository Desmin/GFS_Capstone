Ingredients
. a touch of Oil or Butter for the eggs
. 4 Eggs

. 1 jar of your favorite Salsa

. 1/2 cup Chicken Broth

. about4 handfuls ofTortiIla Chips

. 1/2 cup of Black Beans or any beans

. 1/4 cup Corn

. 1/2 cup Grape Tomatoes Sliced in half

. 1/2 cup Shredded MontereyJack Cheese or your favorite cheese
. 1/2 of an Avocado sliced

. Freshly Ground Pepper

Instructions

1. This meal comes together quickly, so prepare all of the ingredients before you start
cooking. I like to get the eggs going first. I start by heating a skillet over high heat. Once
the skillet is nice and hot I add a drizzle of olive oil. I crack four eggs into the skillet and
immediately cover the skillet. The eggs will take about 4-5 minutes to become perfectly
sunny side up.

2. To make the chilaquiles, heat the salsa and chicken broth in another skillet over medium
heat. Once it begins to simmer, add the tortilla chips. The amount of tortilla chips is a
matter of personal preference. Some people like their chilaquiles on the soupy side while
others prefer them to be drier and crispier, As soon as you have stirred in the chips, add
the beans, corn, and tomatoes. The chilaquiles are ready as soon as the chips and soaked
in salsa and everything is hot.

3. Finish off the chilaquiles by adding the cheese, eggs, avocado, and a touch of black
pepper on top.
