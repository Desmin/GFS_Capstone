Instructions

l, First, prepare the Shortcake. Heat your oven to 400 degrees Then grease an eight-inch cake
pan.

2 Place the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, eggs, and whipping cream in a large
mixing bowl. Stir to combine. The cake batter should have a dough-like consistency.

3. Pour the batter into the cake pan. Bake for 20 minutes at 400 degrees, and then reduce the
heat to 350 degrees and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center
comes out clean. Let cool completely.

4. While the Shortcake bakes, hull and slice the strawberries. Combine the strawberries,
blueberries, lemonjuice, and sugar in a bowl. Let sit for at least 30 minutes. This will make the
berries extra juicy.

5. To make the whipped cream combine the remaining whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla in the
bowl in an electric mixer. Beat on a medium speed until thewhipped cream forms soft peaks.
6. Once the Shortcake has cooled, slice it In half. Add a thick layer of whipped cream. Spoon the

berries on top. Add the second layer of cake on top and decorate with another dollop of
whipped cream and some berries. Serve right away.
